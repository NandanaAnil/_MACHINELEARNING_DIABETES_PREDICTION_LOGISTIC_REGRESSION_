Diabetic Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic based on diagnostic medical data. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, a machine learning model is built to identify patterns and determine diabetes likelihood. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training using various classification algorithms, and performance evaluation.

Key Features:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and NumPy

2. Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

3. Training and comparison of multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)

4. Accuracy evaluation and performance metrics

This project serves as a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques in the healthcare domain.
